    "The previous chapter was concluded by describing how one could use a vector to describe a quantum state. This was followed by giving the example of the most basic form of quantum information, a qubit. However, given that a quantum computer's function is to manipulate and evolve a qubit's state according to certain instructions (also called algorithms), it would seem obvious that what we learned isn't sufficient enough to describe quantum information. In quantum mechanics, a system's state is evolved by what is called an operator, and similarly to how vectors are used to describe a system's state, matrices are used to describe how that state evolves once acted upon by an operator. <a href=\"https://www.numpy.org\">Numpy</a> will also be used for Python implementations."

Similarly, an operator is a mathematical object which transforms a function into a whole other function. An example is the derivative, which yields the rate at which a function is changing. The definition of an operator could be extended to vectors. In other word, an operator maps a vector $|v_1>$ to a new vector $|v_2>$. Notationally, this could be written as follows:\n",
