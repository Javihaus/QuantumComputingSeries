# QuantumComputingSeries
The purpose of this project is to explain quantum information theory using both theory and Python application to a beginner who has little to no experience with the field. Very little pre-requisites are required and I am very confident that any ambitious highschooler can complete this text. The initial form of this series will be in a set of Jupyter notebooks that will eventually be turned into an e-book/video series. Note that if you have any worries, questions, or have spotted any mistakes, you can contact me at any time on programmer3.7@outlook.com

# Module Requirement 

For the Python implementations, the following modules will be necessary:

- Numpy (for linear algebra and math in general)
- QPy (an in-house numerical quantum mechanics solver). It comes with the repository
- Qiskit (a multi-purpose quantum computing framework that will be used for all QC stuff)
- QSim (a basic quantum simulator that we're going to build in the later chapters)


# State of the Project


This project is not my main priority at the moment and will be worked on only when I am free. For this reason, it would be reasonable to expect a 1-2 month timeframe for completion
